Through this project, we seek to demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning in urban planning and public transportation management. The insights derived could be instrumental in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of bike sharing systems in Seoul.


Introduction: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

Project Overview
In this project, we delve into the analysis of bike sharing demand in Seoul, South Korea. With the growing emphasis on sustainable urban mobility and the rising popularity of bike sharing systems, understanding the dynamics of bike sharing demand becomes crucial. Our analysis aims to uncover the patterns and factors influencing this demand, leveraging the power of data science and machine learning.

Objectives
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To visually and statistically explore the relationships between different variables related to bike sharing.
- Predictive Modeling: To build and evaluate various regression models, predicting bike sharing demand based on a range of influencing factors.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: To optimize our models for better accuracy using techniques like Randomized Search CV.
- Insight Generation: To provide actionable insights that could assist in efficient management and planning of bike sharing services in Seoul.
