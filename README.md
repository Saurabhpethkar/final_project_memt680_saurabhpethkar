# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Analysis
## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of bike sharing demand in Seoul, South Korea, addressing the need for sustainable urban mobility. Utilizing data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and factors influencing bike sharing demand, contributing to the efficient management and planning of these services.

## Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visually and statistically explore relationships between various variables related to bike sharing.
Predictive Modeling: Develop regression models to predict bike sharing demand based on influencing factors.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize models using techniques like Randomized Search CV.
Insight Generation: Provide actionable insights for efficient bike sharing service management.

## Data Description
The dataset includes records from Seoul's bike sharing system, with features like temporal data, weather conditions, and user information. Key aspects include:

Temporal Data: Hourly, daily, and seasonal demand variations.
Weather Conditions: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, and snowfall.
User Information: Number of bikes rented per hour and other relevant data.
Methodology
Feature Engineering: Enhanced time-related features for in-depth analysis.
Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and encoded categorical variables.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn, Plotly, Dash
